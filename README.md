The game follows the classic rules of Pig, where the objective is to be the first player to reach a score of 100.
Players take turns rolling a pair of dice and accumulating points based on the values rolled. If a player rolls a "1" on either die, their turn ends and they lose all their accumulated points for that turn. However, players can choose to hold their current score and pass the dice to the next player before rolling a "1".
The game has a sleek and easy-to-use interface, with clear instructions and a user-friendly design. Players can customize the game settings, such as the winning score and the number of dice used, to make the game more challenging.

## Description

This is a simple dice game where two players have the chance to roll the dice to try and achieve a score of 100. Each player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".

The rules of the game are:

- When a player rolls a 1, their total score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.
- When the player rolls a 2 - 6, the score is added to their turn total and they can continue to play
- When the player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- The player who first scores 100 or more points wins.
